README
This is an version of Dungeon of Dooom designed to be ready for coursework two (and three if you choose). Some extra commands and functionality have been added, such as an lantern and extra items to pick up, but the game is still not network or multilayer ready. The game still supports one player, but the classes have been designed so as to enable easy modification to multiple players. The GameLogic class is not thread-safe, and will have to be protected for a multilayer game.  You will probably want to create a turn-based system. 

The code is also designed so it can be extended for coursework three, though you will have the choice of doing that or “networking” your CW1 code and running from there. New items can be added to the game through extending the abstract GameItem class, and skeleton attacking code.
